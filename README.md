Hello! This repository contains my solutions to the book **Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (5th Edition)** when learning about android programming.

## Broken Links in Book?

If you are searching for the database or pizza images, you can find them in the [zip folder](Android-5th-Edition-Solutions.zip).

Since spring of 2025, links in the book has been broken due to the website being retired. This resulted in removed access to an example database used in `CriminalIntent` and pictures used in `CodaPizza`.

Thankfully, the co-author Bryan Sills posted on [forums.bignerdranch.com](https://forums.bignerdranch.com/t/android-5th-edition-solutions-files/24476) a link to the solutions for the 5th edition on his [website](https://bryansills.ninja/android-book).  
[`Android-5th-Edition-Solutions.zip`](Android-5th-Edition-Solutions.zip) is a copy of his uploaded solutions.
